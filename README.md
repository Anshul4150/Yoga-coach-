# YOGA COACH - A human pose estimation application
We present a yoga coach which helps an individual correct their posture using modern deep learning techniques.
Given a video/image our coach helps figure out whether a person is doing the classified pose correctly basedon the similarity of angles between ground truth and
the image.
